1: Paste the files into the correct location
	-the path for the SPIAslave files is 
	 ti\motorware\motorware_1_01_00_15\sw\drivers\drvic\drv8301\src\32b\f28x\f2806x
	
	 
2:  Copy the needed functions from the changes file into the .h and .c files 
	-Then the SPI and PIE driver files will be located at
	 ti\motorware\motorware_1_01_00_15\sw\
	 and they must be placed under DRIVERTYPE\drv8301\src\32b\f28x\f2806x
	-copy and paste according to the CHANGES files
	
3: Copy the needed changes into the HAL and HAL_obj files
	-The path for these files is
	 ti\motorware\motorware_1_01_00_15\sw\modules\hal\boards\boostxldrv8301_revB\f28x\f2806x\src
	-copy functions and declarations according to the CHANGES files
	
	
================// USAGE //=================================
1: You can use the motorware example labs as a template, however to use SPIA as a slave,
	you will need to call HAL_enableSpiInt(halHandle); in the main function before 
	the main loop. Everything else should be initialized for you in the existing motorware stuff

2: In the main loop, you will have to make your own spiISR with prototype
	interrupt void spiISR(void)
	for the test example I simply had the function below.
interrupt void spiISR(void)
{
  // toggle status LED
  HAL_toggleLed(halHandle,(GPIO_Number_e)HAL_Gpio_LED2);
  rdata = HAL_readArduinoData(halHandle);
  ints++;
  return;
}
